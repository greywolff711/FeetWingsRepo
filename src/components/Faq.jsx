                            <h3> Q : Why a Sock?</h3>
                            <p>We believe that you need nothing more than your wardrobe to be able to monitor your health. Moreover, access to the feet allows us to deal with foot ulceration which is one of the most common diabetic disorders and also allows us to give accurate readings for BP and heart rates. And lastly, socks are an integral part of every wardrobe prompting a regular use, in turn, giving you the best results.</p>

                            <h3>Q : Size of the reader, will it be too obtrusive/visible?</h3>
                            <p>No not at all, the reader is only 15mm in diameter and the thickness is less than 1mm.</p>

                            <h3>Q : Will the socks have padding? How comfortable will it be to wear?</h3>
                            <p>Yes, since this is a sock design for diabetics, we have ensured that it has comfortable padding to prevent injuries to the foot especially for neuropathic people. The fabric will be bamboo cotton and is extremely breathable.</p>

                            <h3>Q : How often should I ideally keep the socks on for an accurate reading?</h3>
                            <p>A reading can be acquired with only a few minutes of use but for optimal results that predict your health accurately, we recommend regularly using the socks. That is why we ship 6 pairs of socks/box for ease of use.</p>
